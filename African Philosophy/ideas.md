## Two Nigerian Examples

- Sankofa: In Nigeria, Sankofa is often associated with the Yoruba philosophy of "se wo were fi na wosan kofa a yin o", which translates to "It is not taboo to go back and fetch what you forgot". In web development, this can be applied by revisiting old projects, ideas, or designs to identify areas for improvement and incorporate them in future work.
- Ominira: Ominira is a Yoruba word that means "freedom". In web development, this can be applied by promoting open-source technologies and platforms, which allow for more freedom and flexibility in web development.
